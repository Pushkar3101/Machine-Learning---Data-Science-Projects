## Breast-Cancer-Tumor-Classification :

This project is made to construct predictive models to diagnaose breast camncer tumours. The dataset is taken from Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic) The analysis is divided into four sections :

- Identifying the problem and Data Sources 
- Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Pre-Processing the Data 
- Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is malignant or Benign

I have compared different machine learning models(logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors,support vector classification,GaussianNB) to get the best classification result in predicting benign and malignant tumours.

## Sales_Win_Loss-data-classification :

Classification of Sales_Win_Loss data from IBM's Watson repository First, we visualize the datset then we pereprocessed the data . After preprocessing, we trained annd tested the data by dividing data into training and test sets. We chose the model according to the model_map from scikit learn module by checking the conditions. Then, we compared the performance of all the models. By seeing the performance, we can choose the best one for our dataset. for more details, check scikit-learn : machine learning in python . https://scikit-learn.org/stable/


## Content Based Movie Recommendation System

Content based recommendation of movies . We used movies.csv file as input data for movies database and took an user input of movies, which have been reviewed by the user. Therefore, based on the user profile and genre of other movies we recommended the 10 most suitable movies as per user's interest.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Content-Based Filtering :

#Advantages- Learns user's preferences Highly personalized for the user

#Disadvantages - Doesn't take into account what others think of the item, so low quality item recommendations might happen Extracting data is not always intuitive Determining what characteristics of the item the user dislikes or likes is not always obvious.


## Movie Recommendation System (collaborative filtering)

Movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering. Used movies.csv for movie data and ratings.csv for user ratings of movies.
Based on the reviews of users ,it recommends movie to new user.


## Credit Card Fraud Detection :

Machine Learning Project to check fraudulent transactions. Used dataset creditcard.csv of  nearly 28,500 credit card transactions and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, we  identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud.  

## Predicting the Cost of Used Cars

predicting the cost of used cars hackathon by imarticus.
predicting the costs of used cars given the data collected from various sources and distributed across various locations in India.
Got the accuracy of 89.97%.
