## Breast-Cancer-Tumor-Classification :

This project is made to construct predictive models to diagnaose breast camncer tumours. The dataset is taken from Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic) The analysis is divided into four sections :

- Identifying the problem and Data Sources 
- Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Pre-Processing the Data 
- Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is malignant or Benign

I have compared different machine learning models(logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors,support vector classification,GaussianNB) to get the best classification result in predicting benign and malignant tumours.
